Progress Report:

*Mark these progress points off in some way as they are implemented and finished so we can keep track of what needs to be done*

2.1

CPU bursts
IO bursts
CPU bound
I/O bound

scheduling cases:

System interrupt / wait for I/O.... Change from RUNNING to WAITING
Preemption scheduling ............. Change from RUNNING to READY
I/O devices are ready ............. Change from WAITING to READY
The process terminates

2.2

First come first server
Shortest job first
Priority scheduling

2.3

CPU utilization
Throughput
Turnaround time
Waiting time
Response time
